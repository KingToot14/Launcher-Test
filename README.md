# Sombrero Worm Launcher

## All of the games i've created in one launcher
This currently doesn't inlcude any games, but some betas are coming soon!

## How to use
It's pretty simple, as long as i'm not updating the url list file (which should only take a minute), you can download and launch any of the games I've released onto github.
<br><br>

If you don't have the exe downloaded for the game, you can download it straight from the launcher. This means you'll always stay updated on new releases as long as I update the list. If you'd rather play a different version of a certain gaim, as long as you have the file downloaded, you can!

## Bugs
If you run into any bugs, please make an issue in the issues tab!
